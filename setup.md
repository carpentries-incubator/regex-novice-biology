## Text Editor

If you already have a preferred text editor you can probably
continue to use that to follow this lesson.
Open the "Find/Replace" interface and look for
an option with a label like
"mode", "grep-like", "regular expression" or "regex."

If you are installing a text editor for the first time,
here are a few recommendations:

- For Windows,
  try the freely-available editor 'Notepad++',
  available at [https://notepad-plus-plus.org](https://notepad-plus-plus.org).
- For Mac, TextWrangler is a good generic text editor,
  available free from [http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) or the App Store.
- Sublime Text is another good option,
  available on all operating systems from [https://www.sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com).
